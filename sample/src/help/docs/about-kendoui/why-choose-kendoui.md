### 2. Why Choose KendoUI
<br>

We expect at least two classes of Aurelia-KendoUI components users

1. Existing Telerik KendoUI SDK customers, seeking for the state of the art front end framework, where Aurelia is by far the best alternative

2. Existing Aurelia developers, who are tired of "manual" adaptation of various UI toolkits, all of which expose the same JavaScript based interface as Telerik KendoUI SDK does. While the set of Aurelia KendoUI components is the first in the series of **[Aurelia-UI-Toolkits](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits)** authored bridges, we plan to continue enriching Aurelia development environment with interfaces to other JavaScript toolkist as well.
