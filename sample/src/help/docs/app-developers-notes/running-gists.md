### 4. Running Aurelia-KendoUI components as [gists](https://gist.github.com/)
<br>

This section contains information on the newly added feature which allow you to **RUN** any example available in this application, by invoking the **[GistRun](https://gist.run/)** application, written by Aurelia core team member Jeremy Danyow, who describes it as:

>[GistRun](https://gist.run) runs and edits [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) (surprise). GistRun is built with [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io), uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) provides DNS and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) hosts GistRun's integration with GitHub's OAuth [web application flow](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow).

Here is an example of the KendoUI component with added **RUN** functionality:

Click on the **RUN** button results with this specific grid example running as a gist in the new browser tab:

This allows for a great deal more experimentation with any KendoUI component in a completely interactive way.
