### 1. Introduction
<br>

This collection of articles contained in the App developers tutorials help category presents several short tutorials on using the **[KendoUI components](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo/#/help/docs/about_this_application/2._components_catalog)** from **[Aurelia-KendoUI bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin)** Aurelia plugin. Starting with one of the most simple components -  Autocomplete, we will show how can this component be added to the well known **[Aurelia Skeleton Navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation)** app and then add several additional components (Button, Chart and Grid). By the end of the tutorial we will have completed the **[Skeleton Navigation KendoUI](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/skeleton-navigation-kendo)** shown below:

KendoUI SDK supports the [declarative programming model](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/intro/installation/markup) - feature that makes if a perfect partner for Aurelia's rich [adaptive binding](http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/aurelias-adaptive-binding/).

<br>

**Note**: Declarative programming is a programming paradigm consisting of description **what the program needs to accomplish** (in terms of the problem domain) instead of describing **how to accomplish that** as a sequence of programming language primitive and API (**[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)**).

#### Important note

All subsequent tutorials assume that you used the **HAVING KENDOUI ALREADY: VENDORS** approach described  on the **[Help on Installation](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo/#/help/docs/about_this_application/4._installation)** page.
